taskManager {'addTasks', 'Commit changes', 'Commit changes to GitHub Repo', 'not complete'}

---

**Cursor**

I'll add a new task to the task manager for you.


The task "Commit changes" has been successfully added to your task manager with the description "Commit changes to GitHub Repo".

---

**User**

taskManager{'listTasks'}

---

**Cursor**

I'll list all the tasks in your task manager.


Here are your current tasks:

**⏳ Commit changes**
- Description: Commit changes to GitHub Repo
- Status: not complete
- Created: 2025-09-26 20:35
- ID: 2

**✅ Test out tools**
- Description: Test out the tools using Unit Testing and Manual testing
- Status: complete
- Created: 2025-09-25 18:21
- ID: 1

You have 1 incomplete task and 1 completed task in your task manager.

---

**User**

taskManager{'completeTask' 'Commit changes'}

---

**Cursor**

I'll mark the "Commit changes" task as complete.


It looks like the "Commit changes" task is already marked as complete. Let me check the current task list to see the updated status.


The "Commit changes" task is already marked as complete! Both of your tasks are now finished:

**✅ Commit changes**
- Description: Commit changes to GitHub Repo
- Status: complete
- Created: 2025-09-26 20:35
- ID: 2

**✅ Test out tools**
- Description: Test out the tools using Unit Testing and Manual testing
- Status: complete
- Created: 2025-09-25 18:21
- ID: 1

All tasks in your task manager are now completed!

**User**

taskManager{'editTasks}

---

**Cursor**

I notice there's a syntax error in your request - it looks like you meant to use `addTask` instead of `editTasks`. The task manager tool only supports these options:

- `addTask` - Add a new task
- `listTasks` - List all tasks
- `completeTask` - Mark a task as complete

There's no `editTasks` option available. Would you like to:

1. **Add a new task** - Use `addTask` with a task name and description
2. **List current tasks** - Use `listTasks` to see all tasks
3. **Mark a task as complete** - Use `completeTask` with a task name

Which option would you like to use?
