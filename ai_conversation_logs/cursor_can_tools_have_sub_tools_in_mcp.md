Can a tool in an MCP server have sub tools?

**Cursor**

I'll help you understand whether MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers can have sub-tools. Let me first examine your current MCP setup and then search for information about MCP tool hierarchies.


Let me search for more specific information about MCP tool structure and any potential workarounds for creating tool hierarchies.


Based on my research and examination of your MCP server setup, I can provide you with a clear answer about sub-tools in MCP servers:

## **No, MCP tools cannot have sub-tools in the traditional hierarchical sense.**

Here's what I found:

### **MCP Tool Structure**
- MCP tools are designed as **standalone, independent entities**
- Each tool has a single `name`, `description`, and `inputSchema`
- Tools are flat in structure - there's no built-in parent-child relationship
- The MCP protocol doesn't support nested tool hierarchies

### **What You Can Do Instead**

1. **Multiple Related Tools**: Create separate tools that work together
   ```python
   # Instead of a "file_analyzer" tool with sub-tools
   # Create individual tools:
   Tool(name="count_lines", description="Count lines in a file")
   Tool(name="search_todos", description="Search for TODO comments")
   Tool(name="find_functions", description="Find function definitions")
   ```

2. **Tool with Complex Parameters**: Use a single tool with structured parameters
   ```python
   Tool(
       name="analyze_file",
       description="Analyze a file with various options",
       inputSchema={
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
               "file_path": {"type": "string"},
               "analysis_type": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "enum": ["count_lines", "search_todos", "find_functions", "all"]
               }
           }
       }
   )
   ```

3. **Tool Aggregation**: Use servers like MetaMCP that aggregate multiple MCP servers, but this still doesn't create true sub-tools

### **For Your Project**
Looking at your `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, you're planning to implement:
- **Analyze Files** (with line counting, string searches, etc.)
- **Work Logging** 
- **Task Management**

I'd recommend implementing these as separate, related tools rather than trying to create a hierarchical structure. This approach is more aligned with MCP's design and will be easier to maintain and use.

```python
   # Instead of a "file_analyzer" tool with sub-tools
   # Create individual tools:
   Tool(name="count_lines", description="Count lines in a file")
   Tool(name="search_todos", description="Search for TODO comments")
   Tool(name="find_functions", description="Find function definitions")
```

```python
   Tool(
       name="analyze_file",
       description="Analyze a file with various options",
       inputSchema={
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
               "file_path": {"type": "string"},
               "analysis_type": {
                   "type": "string",
                   "enum": ["count_lines", "search_todos", "find_functions", "all"]
               }
           }
       }
   )
```
