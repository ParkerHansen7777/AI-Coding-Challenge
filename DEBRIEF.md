## Debrief

## What went well


- Researching MCP and making sure I understood its place in the AI landscape was relatively straightforward. I enjoyed learning more about the current capabilities of AI and how it's evolving through AI tools and the use of AI agents. The tools that I developed were pretty simple but have valuable uses that can be utilized by the agents I designed. I enjoyed collaborating with AI, bouncing ideas off it and understanding different ways to achieve my goals. I used Cursor throughout this challenge and found it very helpful in the development process. Developing the tools themselves was pretty straightforward; though they were simple, it was fun to build them and see the Cursor agent use them. 


## What was challenging

- Prior to this challenge, I didn't know what AI Agents were. When researching them, I thought I understood what they were, but when I compared them to AI models like LLMs, my true understanding was realized. Designing the AI agents really helped me grasp their autonomy and uses in the context of MCP, MCP tools, and improving productivity.

- Though not necessarily challenging, there was a learning curve with using the Cursor IDE. Through trial and error and using my previous AI experience, I was able to find success and would use Cursor again in the future. It improved my productivity and accelerated my learning.
